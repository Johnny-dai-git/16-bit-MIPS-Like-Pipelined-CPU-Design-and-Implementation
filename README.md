# A Fully Pipelined 16-bit RISC Processor Featuring Hazard Resolution, Forwarding Logic, and ASIC Physical Implementation
End-to-end CPU design: custom 16-bit MIPS-style ISA + Perl two-pass assembler; VHDL RTL for single-cycle and 5-stage pipeline (hazard detect/forwarding, 2-bit predictor); synthesized &amp; P&amp;R on FPGA with behavioral/post-synth/post-layout verification; ~3× speedup (≈260 ps vs 780 ps).
